REA Sinatra application provisioning script.

This script is used to provision the REA "Hello World" application using the
unicorn application server along with the nginx web server compiled with 
Mod Security support and a basic ruleset.

It is worth noting that the script requires root level permissions to run. 
It also assumes a RHEL/CentOS 6 64bit installation and a network connection is 
configured and working on the server.

To run, extract all of the files in the tarball, then run the following:

sudo ./sinatra_app_prov.sh

This should install all necessary applications, disable any un-necassary
services and configure the web and application servers for startup.
